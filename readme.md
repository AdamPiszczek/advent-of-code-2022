# About
<p align="justify">
My solutions for this year's edition of the Advent of Code 2022 with the usage of Python 3.8.10. While solving these problems, I did NOT intend to focus on the best computational complexity and code clarity so that you can find many duplicate elements or vaguely initialized variables here. All input values generated for my account are in the inputs/ folder. As for the content of the tasks, you can view them at <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022">this link.</a>.
